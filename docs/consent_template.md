## Notes for Organizations

### Customization
This template should be customized to comply with:
- Local privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Organizational policies
- Specific use case requirements

### Best Practices
1. **Obtain consent before recording** - Never start recording without explicit consent
2. **Be transparent** - Clearly explain how recordings will be used
3. **Minimize data collection** - Only record what is necessary
4. **Secure storage** - Use encryption and access controls
5. **Regular audits** - Review retention and deletion policies
6. **Training** - Ensure staff understand privacy requirements
7. **Incident response** - Have a plan for data breaches

### Legal Considerations
- Consult with legal counsel before using this template
- Some jurisdictions require all-party consent for recordings
- Medical, financial, and legal recordings may have additional requirements
- Children's data may require parental/guardian consent

### TalkSmith PII Redaction
TalkSmith provides automated PII redaction, but it should not be relied upon as the sole privacy protection measure:
- Review redacted transcripts before sharing
- Use whitelists for known safe terms (e.g., company emails)
- Consider manual review for sensitive content
- Implement additional security measures as needed

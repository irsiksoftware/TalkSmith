# TalkSmith Example Plan

*Generated from transcript on 2025-10-17 00:29:34*

## Problem Statement

- The main problem we're seeing is that users are struggling to find relevant products quickly. Our analytics show high bounce rates on search results pages. *(00:08)*

## Target Users

- Our target users are busy professionals aged 25-45 who shop during their commute. They need quick, accurate results. *(00:18)*
- We need to implement AI-powered search with natural language processing. This should understand user intent, not just keywords. *(00:35)*
- Another goal is to add personalized recommendations based on browsing history and purchase patterns. *(00:44)*
- For acceptance criteria, we need to ensure search results are relevant at least 85% of the time based on user feedback. *(00:53)*
- One major risk is the AI model might have bias in recommendations. We need to test across diverse user groups. *(01:19)*
- There's also a concern about privacy. We must ensure user data is anonymized and comply with GDPR requirements. *(01:28)*
- For our stakeholders, this includes the product team, marketing, and customer success. They all need to be aligned. *(01:52)*

## Goals & Objectives

- The primary goal is to reduce search time by 50% and increase conversion rate from search by at least 20%. *(00:26)*

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system must handle at least 1000 concurrent searches without degradation. Response time should be under 200 milliseconds. *(01:02)*
- [ ] We should create a fallback mechanism if the AI service is unavailable. Maybe use traditional keyword search as backup. *(01:10)*
- [ ] We need to design a scalable architecture. Should we use microservices or serverless for the search API? *(01:44)*
- [ ] Let's add to the acceptance criteria that we need A/B test results showing statistical significance before full rollout. *(01:59)*
- [ ] We should also build analytics dashboards to track search performance metrics in real-time. *(02:07)*

## Risks & Constraints

- The technical risk is integration complexity. Our current infrastructure might not handle the ML pipeline efficiently. *(01:36)*
- Another concern is budget. The AI service costs could escalate if search volume grows faster than expected. *(02:14)*

## Additional Notes

- Welcome everyone to the product planning meeting. Today we're going to discuss the new mobile app feature. *(00:00)*
- We'll need to implement cost monitoring and set up alerts for unusual spending patterns. *(02:21)*
- That covers the main points. Let's schedule a technical deep dive for next week. *(02:28)*
- Thanks everyone for your input. Meeting adjourned. *(02:34)*

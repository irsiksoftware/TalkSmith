## Problem Statement

- [02:15] We're seeing high churn rates among new users during the onboarding process
- [02:45] Users report confusion about the dashboard layout and where to find key features
- [03:20] Support tickets show that 60% of issues are related to basic navigation problems

## Target Users

- [04:10] Primary users are small business owners with limited technical expertise
- [04:35] Secondary users include team managers who need to delegate tasks
- [05:05] User research shows our audience is typically 35-55 years old, busy professionals

## Goals & Objectives

- [06:20] Reduce onboarding time from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes
- [06:50] Achieve 80% task completion rate for first-time users
- [07:15] Increase user retention from 45% to 70% within first month
- [07:40] Improve user satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.5 out of 5

## Acceptance Criteria

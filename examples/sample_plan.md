# Mobile App Feature Development Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Source:** team_meeting_segments.json

## Problem Statement

Users are experiencing difficulties managing their daily tasks across multiple platforms. The current web-only solution doesn't support offline access, causing productivity loss when internet connectivity is unstable. Customer surveys indicate that 65% of users would prefer a mobile-native experience with push notifications and biometric authentication.

Key pain points:
- No offline access to task lists
- Lack of mobile-optimized UI
- Missing push notifications for task reminders
- No biometric authentication support

## Target Users

Our primary users are:
- **Busy professionals** (ages 25-45) who manage multiple projects simultaneously
- **Remote workers** who need reliable task management across different locations
- **Team leads** who coordinate tasks across distributed teams

User characteristics:
- Tech-savvy with high mobile device usage
- Value quick access and real-time synchronization
- Require offline functionality during travel
- Security-conscious regarding sensitive project data

## Goals & Objectives

The mobile app development aims to achieve:

1. **Expand mobile user base by 40%** within 6 months of launch
2. **Improve task completion rates by 25%** through timely push notifications
3. **Enable offline access** with automatic synchronization when connectivity resumes
4. **Reduce authentication friction** with biometric login (Face ID, fingerprint)
5. **Achieve 4.5+ app store rating** within 3 months

Success metrics:
- Daily Active Users (DAU) growth rate
- Task completion rate improvement
- Average session duration on mobile
- User retention (30-day, 90-day)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) increase

## Acceptance Criteria

The mobile app must meet these requirements:

**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Support both iOS (14+) and Android (10+) platforms
- [ ] Enable full offline mode with local data persistence
- [ ] Synchronize changes automatically when online
- [ ] Support biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
- [ ] Display tasks in optimized mobile layout with swipe gestures

**Performance:**
- [ ] App launches in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Sync completes within 5 seconds for typical user data
- [ ] Offline mode works seamlessly with zero data loss
- [ ] Battery usage remains under 3% per hour of active use

**Quality:**
- [ ] Pass security audit for data encryption
- [ ] Achieve 95%+ crash-free rate
- [ ] Support accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Complete integration testing with existing web platform

## Risks & Assumptions

**Risks:**
- **Platform fragmentation:** Supporting diverse Android devices may require extensive testing resources
- **Data synchronization conflicts:** Offline edits could create merge conflicts requiring complex resolution logic
- **App store approval delays:** Rejection could delay launch timeline by 2-4 weeks
- **API compatibility:** Backend may require updates to support mobile-specific features

**Assumptions:**
- Backend API can handle 3x increase in API calls from mobile users
- Development team has React Native expertise (or will require training)
- Push notification infrastructure is already in place
- Users will grant necessary permissions (notifications, biometrics)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Start beta testing on limited device set, expand gradually
- Implement robust conflict resolution with user-friendly UI
- Prepare comprehensive app store documentation in advance
- Conduct API load testing before mobile launch

## Additional Notes

**Technical Stack:**
- Framework: React Native for cross-platform development
- State management: Redux with Redux Persist for offline support
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + biometric layer
- Local storage: SQLite for offline data
- Push notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging

**Timeline:**
- Sprint 1-2: Core UI and navigation (4 weeks)
- Sprint 3-4: Offline mode and sync logic (4 weeks)
- Sprint 5: Biometric authentication integration (2 weeks)
- Sprint 6: Testing and bug fixes (2 weeks)
- Sprint 7: Beta release and feedback iteration (2 weeks)

**Dependencies:**
- Backend team to provide mobile API documentation by Week 1
- Design team to deliver mobile mockups by Week 2
- Security team to complete authentication audit by Week 8

**Next Actions:**
1. Schedule kickoff meeting with mobile development team
2. Set up React Native development environment
3. Create detailed technical specification document
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline for mobile builds

# Mobile App Performance Improvement Plan

*Generated from transcript on 2025-10-16 14:30:00*

## Problem Statement

- Users are experiencing slow page load times on mobile devices, particularly on 3G connections *(00:02:15)*
- Current page load time averages 5.2 seconds, which is causing user frustration and cart abandonment *(00:02:45)*
- The main issue is that we're loading too many resources upfront without optimization *(00:03:10)*

## Target Users

- Primary users are mobile shoppers aged 25-45 who browse products during their commute *(00:04:30)*
- Secondary stakeholders include the marketing team who need fast landing pages for campaigns *(00:05:00)*
- Customer support team reports that 40% of complaints are related to slow performance *(00:05:30)*

## Goals & Objectives

- Reduce average page load time to under 2 seconds on mobile devices *(00:06:15)*
- Achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90 or higher *(00:06:45)*
- The objective is to increase mobile conversion rate by 20% through performance improvements *(00:07:10)*
- Long-term goal is to maintain fast performance as we add new features *(00:07:40)*

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All pages must pass Core Web Vitals thresholds: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1 *(00:08:20)*
- [ ] The acceptance criteria includes implementing lazy loading for all images below the fold *(00:08:50)*
- [ ] We must have A/B test results showing improved conversion rates before full rollout *(00:09:15)*
- [ ] Performance regression tests should be added to the CI/CD pipeline *(00:09:40)*

## Risks & Constraints

- There's a risk that aggressive image compression might reduce visual quality and hurt brand perception *(00:10:30)*
- Main concern is that implementing lazy loading could break existing analytics tracking *(00:11:00)*
- We have a dependency on the CDN provider for edge caching implementation *(00:11:30)*
- Budget constraint: We only have 2 sprint cycles to complete this work before the holiday season *(00:12:00)*

## Additional Notes

- We should consider using service workers for offline functionality in phase 2 *(00:13:00)*
- The design team wants to ensure loading states don't disrupt the user experience *(00:13:30)*
- Consider partnering with the infrastructure team for CDN optimization *(00:14:00)*
- Next meeting scheduled for October 23rd to review initial implementation *(00:14:30)*
